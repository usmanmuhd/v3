The coding period officially started from May 27. My first task was to [**Remove duplicate Wikidata items from article recommendations**](https://phabricator.wikimedia.org/T216721). I had a clear understanding of what had to be done to fix the issue.
I sent in a patch after making the code changes. My mentor advised me to make a few changes which I fixed and the patch got merged.

During this time, I also attended the MediaWiki Training 2019 organized in Bangalore, India.
It was a great event and I got to meet 4 other GSoCers working with Wikimedia Foundation this year.
We had various hands-on sessions conducted by Jay Prakash and Tito Dutta.
I learnt about MediaWiki, Extentions, Gadgets, ToolsForge and the MediaWiki API.
